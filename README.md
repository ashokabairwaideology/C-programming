Let us take a look at the features of C++

1. Machine Independent

A C++ executable is machine-independent and not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux won’t operate on Windows). Let us comprehend this characteristic of C++ with this instance. Let’s say you have documented a piece of code that can operate on OSes like Linux, Windows/Mac, which makes C++ machine-independent but the executable file of the C++ cannot operate on other operating systems.

2. Simple

C++ is a simple language, programs can be broken down into logical units and it has rich library support and a myriad of data types. Also, C++’s auto Keyword makes life simple.

The auto keyword

The idea of the auto was to create the C++ compiler to figure out the data type while compiling rather than making you declare the data type every time. You have to keep in mind that without an initializer you cannot declare something. There has to be some way for the compiler to deduce your type.

3. High-Level Language

Unlike C which is a mid-level programming language, C++, on the other hand, is a high-level language. It makes life simple to work in C++ as it is closely linked with the human-comprehensible English language.

4. Popular

C++ can be the base language for several other programming languages that backs the object-oriented programming feature. Bjarne Stroustrup found the first object-oriented language ever called Simula 67, which lacked simulations, and decided to design C++.

5. Case-sensitive

It is quite evident that C++ is a very case-sensitive programming language. For instance, cin is utilized to take input from the input stream, but the “Cin” won’t work.

6. Compiler Based

C++ is a compiler-based language, which means C++ programs used to be compiled, and their executable file is made to execute it. Owing to this, C++ is a comparatively faster language than Java and Python.

7. Dynamic Memory Allocation

When the program runs in C++ then the variables are assigned the dynamical heap space. Within the functions, the variables are allotted in the stack space. Several times, we might not be aware of how much memory is required to keep particular pieces of information in a defined variable and the size of needed memory can be specified at run time.

8. Memory Management

C++ lets us allot the memory of a variable or an array during the run time. This is regarded as Dynamic Memory Allocation. In other programming languages like Python and Java, the compiler handles the memories allocated to variables automatically. But such is not the case in C++. In C++, the memory has to be de-allocated dynamically allocated memory manually after it is of no use. The allocation and deallocation of the memory can be performed with the help of the new and delete operators respectively.
